  abstract = {The ability to efficiently sample structurally diverse protein conformations allows
      one to gain a high-level view of a protein's energy landscape. Algorithms from robot motion
      planning have been used for conformational sampling and promote diversity by keeping track
      of ``coverage'' in conformational space based on the local sampling density. However, large
      proteins present special challenges. In particular, larger systems require running many
      concurrent instances of these algorithms, but these algorithms can quickly become memory
      intensive because they typically keep previously sampled conformations in memory to maintain
      coverage estimates. Additionally, many of these algorithms depend on defining useful
      perturbation strategies for exploring the conformational space, which is a very difficult
      task for large proteins because such systems are typically more constrained and exhibit
      complex motions. In this paper, we introduce two methodologies for maintaining and enhancing
      diversity in robotics-inspired conformational sampling. The first method leverages the use
      of a low-dimensional projection to define a global coverage grid that maintains coverage
      across concurrent runs of sampling. The second method is an automatic definition of a
      perturbation strategy through readily available flexibility information derived from
      B-factors, secondary structure, and rigidity analysis. Our results show a significant
      increase in the diversity of the conformations sampled for proteins consisting of up to 500
      residues. The methodologies presented in this paper may be vital components for the
      scalability of robotics-inspired approaches.},
