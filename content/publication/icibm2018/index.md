abstract: Hydrogen/deuterium exchange detected by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) provides valuable
      information on protein structure and dynamics. Although HDX-MS data is often interpreted
      using crystal structures, it was suggested that conformational ensembles produced by
      molecular dynamics simulations yield more accurate interpretations. In this paper, we
      analyse the complement protein C3d through HDX-MS data and evaluate several interpretation
      methodologies, using an existing prediction model to derive HDX-MS data from protein
      structure. We perform an HDX-MS experiment on C3d and, then, to interpret and refine the
      obtained data, we look for a conformation (or conformational ensemble) of C3d that allows
      computationally replicating this data. First, we confirm that crystal structures are not a
      good choice. Second, we suggest that conformational ensembles produced by molecular dynamics
      simulations might not always be satisfactory either. Finally, we show that coarse-grained
      conformational sampling of C3d produces a conformation from which the HDX-MS data can be
      replicated and refined.
