  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms involved in the activation of an immune response is
      essential to many fields in human health, including vaccine development and personalized
      cancer immunotherapy. A central step in the activation of the adaptive immune response is
      the recognition, by T-cell lymphocytes, of peptides displayed by a special type of receptor
      known as Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). Considering the key role of MHC receptors
      in T-cell activation, the computational prediction of peptide binding to MHC has been an
      important goal for many immunological applications. Sequence-based methods have become the
      gold standard for peptide-MHC binding affinity prediction, but structure-based methods are
      expected to provide more general predictions (i.e., predictions applicable to all types of
      MHC receptors). In addition, structural modeling of peptide-MHC complexes has the potential
      to uncover yet unknown drivers of T-cell activation, thus allowing for the development of
      better and safer therapies. In this review, we discuss the use of computational methods for
      the structural modeling of peptide-MHC complexes (i.e., binding mode prediction) and for the
      structure-based prediction of binding affinity.},
